# luciferra

**The elegant bridge between Rust and Lua.**

> An ergonomic library to handle embedded Lua inside Rust programs.

Luciferra is a lightweight, metadata-driven wrapper around [`mlua`](https://crates.io/crates/mlua) that makes embedding Lua in Rust intuitive, structured, and LSP-friendly.

## Why "Luciferra"?

It combines *"Lua"*, *"ferra"* (iron, aka Rust), and *"Lucifer"* (the light-bringer) â€” because it brings clarity, and light to the chaos of embedded scripting.
